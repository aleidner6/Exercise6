## Put your homework on GitHub!

Go [here](https://github.com/llendway/github_for_collaboration/blob/master/github_for_collaboration.md) or to previous homework to remind yourself how to get set up. 

Once your repository is created, you should always open your **project** rather than just opening an .Rmd file. You can do that by either clicking on the .Rproj file in your repository folder on your computer. Or, by going to the upper right hand corner in R Studio and clicking the arrow next to where it says Project: (None). You should see your project come up in that list if you've used it recently. You could also go to File --> Open Project and navigate to your .Rproj file. 

## Instructions

* Put your name at the top of the document. 

* **For ALL graphs, you should include appropriate labels.** 

* Feel free to change the default theme, which I currently have set to `theme_minimal()`. 

* Use good coding practice. Read the short sections on good code with [pipes](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html) and [ggplot2](https://style.tidyverse.org/ggplot2.html). **This is part of your grade!**

* **NEW!!** With animated graphs, add `eval=FALSE` to the code chunk that creates the animation and saves it using `anim_save()`. Add another code chunk to reread the gif back into the file. See the [tutorial](https://animation-and-interactivity-in-r.netlify.app/) for help. 

* When you are finished with ALL the exercises, uncomment the options at the top so your document looks nicer. Don't do it before then, or else you might miss some important warnings and messages.


## Warm-up exercises from tutorial

1. Read in the fake garden harvest data. Find the data [here](https://github.com/llendway/scraping_etc/blob/main/2020_harvest.csv) and click on the `Raw` button to get a direct link to the data. After reading in the data, do one of the quick checks mentioned in the tutorial.


```r
ugly_garden_harvest <- read_csv("ugly_garden_harvest.csv", 
    col_types = cols(...1 = col_skip(), weight = col_number()), 
    skip = 2)
```

  
2. Read in this [data](https://www.kaggle.com/heeraldedhia/groceries-dataset) from the kaggle website. You will need to download the data first. Save it to your project/repo folder. Do some quick checks of the data to assure it has been read in appropriately.


```r
Groceries <- read_csv("Groceries_dataset.csv")
```


3. Create a table using `gt` with data from your project or from the `garden_harvest` data if your project data aren't ready. Use at least 3 `gt()` functions.


```r
gar <- garden_harvest %>%
  # gt(rowname_col = "row",
  #   groupname_col = "group", 
  gt() %>%
  cols_move_to_start(columns = "date") %>%
  tab_header(title = "Lisa's Garden Harvest") %>%
  fmt_date(columns = date, date_style = 5) %>%
  gt_preview()

gar
```

<!-- 4. CHALLENGE (not graded): Write code to replicate the table shown below (open the .html file to see it) created from the `garden_harvest` data as best as you can. When you get to coloring the cells, I used the following line of code for the `colors` argument: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->

<!-- ggraph <- garden_harvest %>% -->
<!--   gt() -->

<!-- ggraph -->
<!-- colors = scales::col_numeric( -->
<!--       palette = paletteer::paletteer_d( -->
<!--         palette = "RColorBrewer::YlGn" -->
<!--       ) %>% as.character() -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ![](garden_table.html){width=600, height=1000} -->

  
5. Use `patchwork` operators and functions to combine at least two graphs using your project data or `garden_harvest` data if your project data aren't read.
  
  

```r
g1 <- garden_harvest %>%
  filter(vegetable %in% "lettuce") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weight)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkgreen", 
                 color = "white",
                 binwidth = 30) +
  labs(title = "Weight of Lettuce Harvests",
       x = "Weight in Grams", 
       y = "Number of Harvests") +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "snow1"),
        text = element_text(family = "Times"))

lettuce_set <- garden_harvest %>%
  filter(vegetable == "lettuce") #only lettuce data. 

g2 <- lettuce_set %>% #trying to do descending order
  group_by(variety) %>%
  summarize(number_days = n()) %>%
  #arrange(desc(number_days)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = number_days, 
             x=fct_reorder(variety, number_days), 
             fill = variety)) +
  geom_col(width=0.4) +
  labs(title = "How many times was each lettuce variety harvested?",
       x = "",
       y = "Number of Times Harvested",) +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "snow1"),
        text = element_text(family = "Times"), 
        axis.text.x=element_blank(), 
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())

patchwork <- (g2 + g1)
patchwork + plot_annotation(title = "Look at these lettuce plots")
```

## Webscraping exercise (also from tutorial)

Use the data from the [Macalester Registrar's Fall 2017 Class Schedule](https://www.macalester.edu/registrar/schedules/2017fall/class-schedule/#crs10008) to complete all these exercises.


```r
fall2017 <- read_html("https://www.macalester.edu/registrar/schedules/2017fall/class-schedule/#crs10008")
```


6. Find the correct selectors for the following fields. Make sure that each matches 762 results:
  * Course Number x
  * Course Name x
  * Day x
  * Time x
  * Room x
  * Instructor x
  * Avail. / Max x

## [1] "The main objectives of this introductory course are: to explore the historical construction of racial categories in the United States; to understand the systemic impact of racism on contemporary social processes; to consider popular views about race in the light of emerging scholarship in the field; and to develop an ability to connect personal experiences to larger, collective realities. We will engage several questions as a group: What are the historical and sociological foundations of racial categories? When does focusing on race make someone racist? What is white privilege, and why does it matter? All students will be asked to think and write about their own racial identity. This course, or its equivalent, is required for majors and minors.

As awareness increases, why are we not able to develop effective or meaningful responses?  Our interdisciplinary and integrative approach will employ multiple methods of inquiry and expression, including: self-reflective essays and maps; a scavenger hunt along University Avenue; library research; and deep, critical analysis of arguments about race/ethnicity/assimilation/multiculturalism.  We will practice engaging in open-ended conversations so that we might discover the questions that truly matter to each of us. To fulfill the WA general education writing requirement, this course will invite you to produce at least 20 pages of college-level writing through various assignments.

## [4] "Americans, at least since the Founding era, have cherished the ideal of political equality. Unlike European nations, the United States did not inherit economic class distinctions from a feudal past. But time and again, American social reformers and mass movements have highlighted inconsistencies between the value of equality and the actual practice of democracy. Through the extension of rights to citizens who were previously excluded or treated as second-class citizens, such as women and African Americans, the polity has become more inclusive. But over the last three decades American citizens have grown increasingly unequal in terms of income and wealth. The central question posed by this course is the implications of such vast economic inequality for American democracy. Do these disparities between citizens curtail, limit, and perhaps threaten the functioning of genuinely representative governance? In this course will 1) Explore what other social scientists, mostly economists and sociologists, know about contemporary inequality, particularly in terms of its causes, manifestation, and socio-economic effects; 2) Consider the concept of inequality in political theory and in American political thought, and; 3) Examine the current relationship between economic inequality and each of three major aspects of the American political system: political voice, representation, and public policy.

In Motion emphasizes the idea that both African Americans and the stories of their lives in the United States are fluid, varied and continually being reinterpreted.

Some of the important themes include movement/mobility/migration; work/labor; resistance to systems of oppression; gender/sexuality/culture/performance; politics/citizenship; and sites of (re)memory. While the course is geographically situated in the United States, we will also consider African American life, culture, thought and resistance in global perspectives.

Too often, the narrative of the “strong black woman” infuses stories of African American women’s resistance which, coupled with a culture of dissemblance, makes the inner workings of their lives difficult to imagine. This course, at its heart, seeks to uncover the motivations, both personal and political, behind African American women’s activism. It also aims to address the ways in which African American women have responded to the pressing social, economic, and political needs of their diverse communities.

Through analysis of select case studies, we will probe the complex interplay of social, historical, political, and economic factors that are invoked to explain modern refugee-producing conflicts. We will consider how refugees act and are acted upon in these settings and in their aftermath. We will examine critically the ways refugees are defined and described qualitatively and quantitatively, as such discourse determines access to certain entitlements and influences humanitarian and governmental responses. We will consider how refugees are defined in terms of time and space, yet simultaneously redefine time and space as transnational actors. Once we have a better understanding of the nature of the collective experience of war and its effects on refugees and others, we will consider issues of power, ethics, and human rights embedded in humanitarian responses to conflict by examining the roles of those who engage in humanitarian work in U.S. and international settings. Our scope of inquiry includes humanitarian workers broadly conceived, including journalists, human services providers, government workers, researchers, faith-based organizations, and others. In addition to probing the ways that outsiders react to refugee concerns, we will also examine indigenous institutional coping mechanisms—such as family and religion—that facilitate social reconstruction in times of transition. The format of the course will be in-depth discussion, lectures, guest speakers, films, and a field research project that will involve cultural life history interviews with an individual engaged in humanitarian work.

During this time, ranging from the Manchu rule of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) to the 21st century, we see the dynamic development of modern subjectivities, evolving cultural connoisseurship, ethnic tensions, new definitions of citizenry, and counter-movements led by cynical agitators. Art and design played a critical role in these developments, functioning as a symbolic language through which identities and communities could form. This class draws on themes such as gender, sexuality, militarism, ethnicity, and commodity culture as well as theories of embodiment by scholars such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Paul Crowther to delve into the rich resonance between representation and identity formation. Students will not only learn to look closely at and write critically about a variety of media including paintings, calligraphy, prints, films, posters, performance art, and installations, but will also relate this historical cultural production to contemporaneous artistic, social, and political discourses.

This course serves as an introduction to the grammar an script of Sanskrit, and we will advance to a point of reading simplified texts from the classical epic Ramayana.Students will be expected to attend class regularly and spend at least ten hours a week outside class studying the grammar and vocabulary. Without this sort of effort, no progress is possible in such a complex language.

In doing this, we trace the development of two related archetypes: the middle-class salaryman and the adolescent girl (shojo). These figures - as well as their incarnations as cyberpunks and mecha-warriors, sex workers and teen rebels - help us explore Japanese film's engagement with the strictures of middle-class society, the constrained status of women, fantasy and escapism, sexuality and desire. Weekly screenings and discussion will be supplemented by readings in film theory and cultural criticism.

This class explores the inherent relationship between material practices and shifting subjectivities, that is the resonance between the physical external world and internal, thinking subject. During this time, ranging from the Manchu rule of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) to the 21st century, we see the dynamic development of modern subjectivities, evolving cultural connoisseurship, ethnic tensions, new definitions of citizenry, and counter-movements led by cynical agitators. Art and design played a critical role in these developments, functioning as a symbolic language through which identities and communities could form. This class draws on themes such as gender, sexuality, militarism, ethnicity, and commodity culture as well as theories of embodiment by scholars such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Paul Crowther to delve into the rich resonance between representation and identity formation. Students will not only learn to look closely at and write critically about a variety of media including paintings, calligraphy, prints, films, posters, performance art, and installations, but will also relate this historical cultural production to contemporaneous artistic, social, and political discourses.

Topics under discussion include: how masculine and feminine virtues became emblems of a nation striving for modernity; how films were politically appropriated for socialist construction; how the revolutionary past has been cinematically framed, remembered and critiqued in the post-Mao era; and how China’s deep tradition was consciously or unconsciously re-created and revised as a spectacle to engage the curious gaze of the global market.The course starts from the silent film period and extends to the fifth generation directors, underground filmmaking, and the revival of martial arts genre in the greater China area. Feature films from mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong will be screened and discussed. Secondary articles and books are also assigned in conjunction with the films. The course is organized thematically and moves chronologically. No prior knowledge of China or Chinese is required."},{"1":"CHIN 305-01","2":"Third Year Chinese I","3":"MWF","4":"01:10 pm-02:10 pm","5":"NEILL 111","6":"Xin Yang","7":"11 / 20","8":"","9":"Continuation of CHIN 204.

Greek drama and epic poetry raise timeless and crucial questions about the effects of martial aggression and the toll that it takes upon both the victims of warfare and the combatants that suffer and inflict violence. We will pursue targeted readings of Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Aristophanes, as well as explore the growing body of scholarship around how these authors respond to the aftermath and consequences of war. We will also seek systematically to draw connections between modern-day understandings of combat trauma and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and injuries endured by familiar figures in the Greek mythic tradition (such as Achilles, Ajax, Medea, Odysseus, and Hecuba). The primary goal of these efforts will be to open new avenues of understanding between the distant past of ancient Greece and the present, as well as to foster a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by victims of war, systematic violence and institutional betrayal.

The course will focus on U.S. identities in relation to age, race, gender, sexuality, and class in a context of literary experimentation. The texts in this course, although all are “American,” explore many differences within a national identity by conducting literary “experiments”: blending genres, creating new literary forms, combining print and image, or writing speculative fiction. How do our authors stretch received forms, or invent new ones, so as to accommodate the content of their characters’ lives? How might speculative fiction and futurism be especially suited to represent experiences of people of color, and particularly of girls and women of color? We will study works by Sandra Cisneros, Junot Díaz, Octavia Butler, Claudia Rankine, and Janelle Monáe, among others. Course requirements include: an in-class oral presentation, a brief written response to each primary reading, and three essays of about 5-7 pages each (one of which must be revised). This course will fulfill either the foundation course in literature requirement or the literature by U.S. writers of color requirement for the English major."},{"1":"ENGL 115-01","2":"Shakespeare","3":"MWF","4":"12:00 pm-01:00 pm","5":"MAIN 001","6":"Penelope Geng","7":"7 / 20","8":"Writing WA","9":"Shakespeare has been called the “star of poets” and “wonder of the stage.” How do his plays delight, puzzle, and instill “wonder”? How did he transform Renaissance poetry? In this course, we will focus on some of Shakespeare’s most enduring works, including the Sonnets, Twelfth Night, Richard II, Henry IV, Part 1, Macbeth, Hamlet, King Lear, and The Tempest. Our study comprises class discussion, essays, presentations, and performances (watching professional productions and performing scenes from the plays). We will analyze Shakespeare’s formal and stylistic technique. We will examine issues of character, action, and plot. For centuries, Shakespeare has inspired writers to perfect their craft and pursue their creative ambitions.

Fortunately, poems make this difficult and ask us to attend more closely to how language does the things that it does. How, for example, can a single word generate multiple, even conflicting, interpretations concerning its significance? How do the rhetorical devices foregrounded in poetry—such as metaphor, metonymy, apostrophe, and personification—structure the modes of relation through which we organize our lives? How do various arrangements of words move us to tears, open new worlds, instigate actions, and even make nothing happen (as W. H. Auden famously poeticizes the power of poetry)? This introductory course will take up such questions as we develop our abilities to read, write, and think as students of literature. While our primary focus will be on learning how to engage with the subtleties of poetic language, this engagement will lead us to consider the broader philosophical, political, and cultural issues that our readings raise, concerning, for example, the place of poetry in modern life, the use and uselessness of poetry, and the very question of what poetry is. This course counts as a foundation course toward the English major, but all students are welcome and no prior knowledge or experience is expected."},{"1":"ENGL 136-01","2":"Drama: Theater and Politics","3":"MWF","4":"02:20 pm-03:20 pm","5":"MAIN 111","6":"Andrea Kaston Tange","7":"1 / 20","8":"Writing WA","9":"What relationships exist between theater, current events, and the public?

It has been a means of offering public commentary, challenging or upholding norms, voicing a protest, or offering an alternative view that presents a world the writers would prefer to live in. In ENGL 136, we will read plays--both classic and modern--as literary texts and talk about the craft that went into their writing. But we will also take field trips to see several plays at different theaters in Minneapolis and St. Paul; we will study theater reviews and write some of our own; we will meet people who work on technical aspects of productions (like lighting and costumes) and learn about the craft of building productions; and we will think, talk, and write about the relationship between the dramatic arts and current events. As part of our larger goal of putting theater in context, the \"current\" events we study will cover topics as diverse as science vs religion, processes of nation building, personal identities put on trial, class politics and accents, and historical notions of property, and the work we read will range from Shakespeare to the present."},{"1":"ENGL 137-01","2":"Novel: Literature","3":"TR","4":"01:20 pm-02:50 pm","5":"MAIN 011","6":"James Dawes","7":"0 / 16","8":"Writing WA","9":"In this course we will read some of the most popular novels ever written in the United States.

For example, can the beautiful be political? What happens to nature's beauty in an era of environmental crisis? And how are shifting gender norms redefining beauty in today's world? The novels we will study critique and analyze these issues even as they revel in the complexity of beauty across time, space, artistic forms, media, and cultures.

As we all know, the longest and most difficult journey is to know ourselves, and the most difficult and joyful way to get there is through poetry. We’ll study modes of expression in poetry, fiction and creative non-fiction writing, learn how to create imagery, figurative language, sound, rhythmic structures, voice, plot, character, point of view…as carriers to reach the other shore. Techniques are not their own ends, but tools to find our voices for expression and communication. Where there is content (story), there is form, just as where there is water, there’s river. Meditation, reading, critiquing and writing exercises will help us find the right forms for the contents. We will learn how to read work aloud in class. Reading aloud is not only to complete the writing process, but also to train the ear for sound, rhythm, image, and the flow. It also teaches both the reader and listeners the art of criticism.

What is old, middle, and early modern English? How does lyric formally (and thematically) differ from epic and romance? When did drama acquire its characteristic structure? What dangers did female writers face in a patriarchal culture? How did they claim poetic or spiritual authority and articulate their right to speak? And more broadly, how did literary writers respond to the invention of the printing press, Luther’s Reformation, the union of Scotland and England under James I, and the English Civil War? We’ll address these questions and many more.  Rich in soil but poor in military defense, early England presented an attractive target for foreign invaders. By the tenth century, England had been conquered by the Romans (Julius Caesar: “I came, I saw, I conquered”), the Celts, the Angles, the Saxons, and the Danes. In 1066, William of Normandy emerged as the victor of the Battle of Hastings, inaugurating an era of Norman (French) rule in England. While violent and destructive, each invasion fertilized English culture with new ideas, practices, and languages. For example, the cosmopolitanism of medieval English culture is evident in Chaucer’s poems, which combined French, Italian, Latin, and Anglo-Saxon languages and poetic forms. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, writers including Philip Sidney, Mary Sidney Herbert (Philip’s sister), Christopher Marlowe, Edmund Spenser, Shakespeare, John Donne, Aemilia Lanyer, Elizabeth Carey, Mary Wroth, and Milton boldly experimented with English poetry, drama, and prose, publishing their works in both manuscript and print. The ascension of King James in 1603 was a watershed moment in the unification of the British Isles. An idea of a British empire, one to rival the Spanish and French, began to take shape. Growing in economic and military power, Britain expanded its boundaries during the seventeenth century. Nationalism in turn inspired fresh debate about what it meant to write, think, act, and live as a “British” subject."},{"1":"ENGL 208-01","2":"Literary Publishing","3":"W","4":"07:00 pm-10:00 pm","5":"MAIN 010","6":"Anitra Budd","7":"6 / 20","8":"","9":"To the average person, the field of literary publishing can seem somewhat opaque.

The centerpiece of the course will involve working with a local writer to produce finished, bound copies of their work. In collaboration with each other and the author, students will edit the work, create publicity and marketing plans, design potential covers, and develop a sales and distribution strategy. We will also explore the history of literary and small press publishing, as well as recent technology trends in the field.

Traditionally, the nineteenth century has been divided into two distinct literary-historical eras, the Romantic (~1798 – 1837) and the Victorian (~1837 – 1901), and you’ll become familiar with the major authors and developments of each, as well as with some of the lasting stories we tell to explain the differences between them. Yet we’ll also be interested in questioning some of the commonplaces that uphold this literary-historical division, for example the idea that the Victorian era, as compared to the Romantic, is “deeply unpoetical” (as Victorian poet and critic Matthew Arnold has it), or the notion that Romantic-era novels were “transitional” in the development of Victorian literary realism. We’ll focus our attention on questions of form, genre, and poetics, and we’ll do so in the broader context of a discussion concerning the thematic concerns of the writers we study, the historical and cultural changes to which they responded, and the relevance of their works today. Possible authors include Matthew Arnold, Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontë, Emily Brontë, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Robert Browning, Lord Byron, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Thomas Hardy, Gerard Manley Hopkins, John Keats, Christina Rossetti, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, George Bernard Shaw, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Charlotte Smith, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Lord Tennyson, Oscar Wilde, and William Wordsworth."},{"1":"ENGL 272-01","2":"Love and Madness in 19th Century American Literature","3":"TR","4":"09:40 am-11:10 am","5":"MAIN 010","6":"James Dawes","7":"1 / 20","8":"","9":"Our common vocabulary of love presents it as a force that strikes and knocks down its victims. It comes like a fever and it disables cognition. Lovers \"fall,\" they are \"smitten,\" \"head over heels,\" \"crazy\" for each other. Love is both mania and obsession, both a euphoria that alters one's view of the world as a whole and an exclusion of the whole world, a radical narrowing of our normally capacious imaginative and perceptual faculties down to the simplest and smallest of human frames: a face, or the sound of a voice. For American authors of the 18th and 19th century, love and madness were twinned sites of altered consciousness that represented the radical \"others\" of Enlightenment reason, psychic parallels to and extensions of the wilds of the New World and the uncontrollable crowds and freedoms of the new democracy. This course will examine love and madness from multiple perspectives, including the Enlightenment and counter-Enlightenment, gender and sexuality, the American Gothic, violence, and sin. Authors will range from Benjamin Franklin and the Marquis de Sade to Edgar Allan Poe and Kate Chopin.

He’s right of course; fiction has always come out fiction. Sometimes to uncover a marginalized voice, or to humanize a demon (Jane Eyre/Wide Sargasso Sea). Sometimes to make troublingly round, the reassuringly flat (Great Expectations/Jack Maggs). And sometimes to view a story from back then in a point of view that reflects us now (Huckleberry Finn/Huck Way Out West). All these stories came out of stories that compelled the author to respond.  This is what you will be doing next semester: writing Fiction as a response to Fiction. The dismissed voice, the monster with a soul, the character without agency, the character everybody but you forgot. The villain. The punch line. The caricature. The racist joke. Who can you uncover? What can you take (or reject) and make your own? Which story demands another view? What was merely hinted at, that you could bring to the fore? Reaction/Fiction will be conducted for the most part in workshop format with the emphasis on continuing to develop writing skills, but it will also involve extensive readings and discussion of several examples of short and long fiction. Reaction/Fiction is where you will twist, turn and violate, but it will also uncover, re-humanize and dignify.

Plays such as Titus Andronicus, The Merchant of Venice, Measure for Measure, Hamlet, and Othello stage a spectrum of responses to insult, injury, and violence. At the same time, the texts trouble the division between good and evil, justice and revenge.

The first goal is to provide students with the opportunity to develop an original research project that reflects their deepest aesthetic interests and ethical commitments. Working closely with a faculty member and a small group of peers, students will develop projects that display rigorous literary scholarship and methodological inventiveness. The second goal is to provide instruction in advanced methods of research by studying influential critical approaches from the early twentieth century to the present. Specific theories and methods will be determined in consultation with the instructor. Past courses have emphasized psychoanalysis, post-Marxist criticism, gender, queer, and feminist theory, phenomenology, critical race theory, post-colonial criticism, poetics, law and human rights, and aesthetics. The final goal is to train students to become advocates of their research agenda. Students will learn to lecture and lead discussion on relevant readings and to share their research with the wider intellectual community in a form that reflects the spirit of the project.  This seminar, Virginia Woolf: Film, Theory, Media, will explore the work of British novelist Virginia Woolf across a range of media. Woolf's legacy overflows the bounds of the page. In the words of critic Brenda Silver, \"she is a phenomenon—icon, celebrity, star.\" In looking at the way Woolf circulates in film, multimedia artworks, and cultural theory, students will develop a greater understanding of how literary modernism persists across the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

In other words learning alongside someone doing something completely different is the POINT.  Projects will be done seminar style, meaning in a workshop environment for advanced students with clearly defined projects in poetry, fiction, creative nonfiction, drama or a combination/invention of your own choice (!) The seminar will center initially on a group of shared readings about the creative process and then turn to the work produced by class members. Through the presentation of new and revised work, and the critiquing of work-in-progress, each student will develop a significant body of writing as well as the critical skills necessary to analyze the work of others."},{"1":"ENVI 140-01","2":"The Earth's Climate System","3":"MWF","4":"10:50 am-11:50 am","5":"NEILL 401","6":"Louisa Bradtmiller","7":"16 / 44","8":"Quantitative Thinking Q3","9":"When is writing an act of resistance?

At its most basic, this class is an introduction to the materials and structure of the Earth, and to the processes acting on and in the Earth to produce change. We will begin to learn the language of geology through a study of plate tectonics, planetary structure, and rocks of all sorts. I am particularly interested in the physical forces that shape the surface of the Earth, and I am excited to teach you about a multitude of surface processes that shape our planet (rivers and glaciers and landslides, oh my!) and tell you about my research on glaciers and in rivers. The planet has begun to show signs of our expanding population and the increasing need for natural resources, and we will consider the feedbacks between humans and the Earth as well. Broadly, the goals of the course are three-fold: first, to introduce the materials and processes that govern the evolution of the Earth; second, to examine global environmental changes in the context of natural processes; and third, to inspire you to develop a lifelong interest in the planet on which you reside. The course begins with an overview of the origin of the solar system and other planets. Next, you will learn about Earth materials and how to interpret the significance of minerals and rocks in the context of our dynamic planet. We will examine the composition, structure, and evolution of the interior of our planet, as well as the well-accepted (but not complete) model of plate tectonics. We will also spend time examining the forces that shape our continental surfaces, including surface and groundwater movement, hillslope processes, coastlines, wind and deserts, and glacial processes. Throughout the course, I will strive to link the academic study of our planet to ‘real-life’ situations and events, and demonstrate the importance of understanding earth processes to being an educated global citizen. Finally, through explicit writing instruction and several fun assignments, you will improve upon your argumentative writing skills in the scientific context.

With these changes, new narratives emerged that we continue to see even in today's culture. They asked questions such as: why do two people fall in love? Why does an individual strive for a better social standing? Is empathy possible in a capitalist society? The answers to these questions are complex, and often relate to what is known as \"mimetic desire,\" a term coined by French theorist Rene Girard in his book Deceit, Desire and the Novel (Le mensonge romantique et la verite romanesque). We will examine the relationships of deceit and desire to money and the marketplace in 19th-century France, and, in the process, learn more about our own society. This course offers a survey of 19th century French literature (novels, plays, short stories, and poetry) linked to the theme of the course, including works by Audouard, Balzac, Desbordes-Valmore, Flaubert, Hugo, Sand, Zola, and others.

The goal is less to theorize something like a “minor fantastic literature\" or to embark on a search for well-established or emerging forms and genres, including the gothic, fantasy or science-fiction in their possible declensions in contemporary francophone Africa, than to expose students to a wide variety of literary and cinematic practices involving, in one way or another, some aspects of the fantastic, broadly understood as a textually staged vacillation of rational categories.  The first part of the course is devoted to a preliminary theoretical discussion of some seminal essays and studies (Castex, Caillois, Vax, Todorov), supplemented with readings of Maupassant (Le Horla) and Balzac (La Peau de chagrin), so that students can get a critical understanding of the fantastic narrative, in its relation to affiliated genres such as the marvelous and the strange, as a trouble in the real.  In the second part, we will study fiction and film from francophone African writers and filmmakers who, in their various modes of trafficking in the irrational and the supernatural, in their use of elements culled from the fantastic to further aesthetic ends or to make a compelling ethical argument, evince in each individual case a purpose-oriented and hands-on approach to this narrative genre as simply a toolbox for collages and bricolages of their own devising. Authors and works will include, among others: Sembene Ousmane (Xala), Souleymane Cisse (Yeleen), Djibril Mambety (Hyenes), Jean-Pierre Bekolo (Les Saignantes), Boris Diop (Les Petits de la Guenon), Sony Labou-Tansi (La Vie et demie), Koulsy Lamko (La Phalene des collines), Khady Sylla (Le Jeu de la mer), and Alain Mabanckou (Memoires de porc-epic)."},{"1":"GEOG 111-01","2":"Human Geography of Global Issues","3":"TR","4":"09:40 am-11:10 am","5":"CARN 107","6":"David Lanegran","7":"13 / 35","8":"Internationalism","9":"This course is an introduction to the global perspectives, basic concepts and fundamental questions of geography.

This variety of environments also fosters great cultural diversity: although the nations of Latin America share similar historical roots, each one has its own character and its own complex geography. This course explores the geography of Latin America through a combination of thematic and regional approaches. Major topics include physical geography and the natural environment; pre-Columbian, colonial, and modern history; race and identity; urbanism; agriculture and land use; major environmental problems; economy and development; international migration; Latino culture and identity in the U.S.; and the economic and cultural impacts of globalization. Along with such general themes, we will also examine the cultural geography of specific core regions, including The Caribbean, Mexico, Brazil, the Andean Countries, and the Argentine Pampas. Since this is a first-year course, we will also emphasize developing your skills in written and oral communication, scholarly research, and information literacy.

At its most basic, this class is an introduction to the materials and structure of the Earth, and to the processes acting on and in the Earth to produce change. We will begin to learn the language of geology through a study of plate tectonics, planetary structure, and rocks of all sorts. I am particularly interested in the physical forces that shape the surface of the Earth, and I am excited to teach you about a multitude of surface processes that shape our planet (rivers and glaciers and landslides, oh my!) and tell you about my research on glaciers and in rivers. The planet has begun to show signs of our expanding population and the increasing need for natural resources, and we will consider the feedbacks between humans and the Earth as well. Broadly, the goals of the course are three-fold: first, to introduce the materials and processes that govern the evolution of the Earth; second, to examine global environmental changes in the context of natural processes; and third, to inspire you to develop a lifelong interest in the planet on which you reside. The course begins with an overview of the origin of the solar system and other planets. Next, you will learn about Earth materials and how to interpret the significance of minerals and rocks in the context of our dynamic planet. We will examine the composition, structure, and evolution of the interior of our planet, as well as the well-accepted (but not complete) model of plate tectonics. We will also spend time examining the forces that shape our continental surfaces, including surface and groundwater movement, hillslope processes, coastlines, wind and deserts, and glacial processes. Throughout the course, I will strive to link the academic study of our planet to ‘real-life’ situations and events, and demonstrate the importance of understanding earth processes to being an educated global citizen. Finally, through explicit writing instruction and several fun assignments, you will improve upon your argumentative writing skills in the scientific context. The course has no prerequisites, and I expect most of you may not have had a physical or environmental sciences course since middle school!

Not only do we have and impose on the world our moral, aesthetic, and exchange values, but these three fields often become difficult to distinguish, as is evident in the slippery flexibility of words that allow us to say as much “this painting is bad or worthless” as “I think this person is bad or worthless,” or “this is a bad, or worthless, remark” and “this is a bad or worthless check.” This course will focus primarily on influential accounts of value in aesthetic theory, while also examining the ways in which aesthetic value demarcates itself from or implicates its moral and economic counterparts, and what the interplays among the three fields entail for aesthetic value. Our readings will focus on the impact of primarily German thought on the formation of modern aesthetic theory—from the early eighteenth century through the Enlightenment and Romanticism to high modernism and the Frankfurt School.

Perhaps no two thinkers have asked this question as persistently and approached it with such intrepid originality as Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud. Writing in an age when religious belief had lost credence as a foundation for ethics, Nietzsche and Freud confronted the groundlessness of value systems while recognizing the impossibility of living without them. Both were reacting to Darwin’s discovery of natural selection, which dispelled nature’s divine aura and inaugurated what Nietzsche would call the “death of God.” The course explores the challenges to value judgments in the wake of Darwin and attempted solutions to them, centering on the four domains of ethics, subjectivity, aesthetics, and cultural value. Readings will include excerpts from Darwin’s The Origin of Species; Nietzsche’s The Genealogy of Morals, The Gay Science, and the texts posthumously published as The Will to Power; Freud’s Totem and Taboo, Civilization and Its Discontents, and Beyond the Pleasure Principle; as well as other works.

The course will also outline continuing struggle for freedom, for cultural and even their physical survival, by examining specific literature and cultural production authored by 20th and 21st century indigenous and non-indigenous authors from North, Central and South America. The chosen literature and cultural texts will illustrate trans-cultural and de-colonization processes, and resistance to assimilation. The following authors and films will be the source of our readings and class discussion: Sherman Alexie (The Toughest Indian in the World, 2000), Jose Maria Arguedas (Yawar Fiesta, 1941), Victor Montejo (Testimony: Death of a Guatemalan Village, 1987; and Sculpted Stones, 1995), Rigoberta Menchú (I Rogoberta Menchú. An Indian Woman in Guatemala, 1983), and Subcomandante Marcos (Questions And Swords. Folktales of the Zapatista Revolution, 2001); among the films, \"Spirit: The Seventh Fire (2005),\" \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (2007),\" \"Cabeza de Vaca (1993),\" \"The Mission (1986),\" and \"A Place Called Chiapas (1998).\" Students will also read and discuss theories proposed by Erica-Irene Daes (United Nations Human Rights Prize 1993), Ronald Niezen, Walter Mignolo, Jeffrey Sissons, among others. This course fulfills the WA (Argumentative Writing) requirement. Students will have the opportunity to learn how to construct a solid argumentative assay.

In the New World, Spaniards employed many of the same discursive and legal tactics - along with brute force - to subject Amerindian and African peoples to their will and their cultural norms. But indigenous and African populations in the Americas actively countered colonization. They rejected slavery and cultural imposition through physical rebellion, the use of strategies of cultural preservation and the appropriation of phonetic writing, which they in turn wielded against European hegemony. We will examine a fascinating corpus of indigenous pictographic codexes, architecture, myths, and histories and letters of resistance, along with a rich spectrum of texts in which peoples of African descent affirm their own subjectivity in opposition to slavery and cultural violence.

To understand this turning point, we will compare contemporaneous cases of individuals who practiced magic, science and religion and ran afoul of authorities.

In this course, we will find out by investigating the history of complex religious practices such as Haitian Voudou, which originated with West African Vodou and Kongolese religious practices as the slaves from these regions were brought to the island of Hispaniola during the trans-Atlantic slave system and changed over time as people continuously interacted across the Atlantic world. We will also explore other African-based religions. For example, the orisha religions of Yoruba peoples in West Africa came to places such as Brazil and Cuba at various points in both the legal and illicit slave trading periods. Peoples of African descent experienced a bricolage of cultural impacts and remade themselves in the Americas but did not forget ties to the homeland. Religions such as Christianity and Islam also inserted themselves into these communities and emerged intertwined. The movements of Africans and their descendants came to North America adapting and adopting even more of their practices to meet specific needs. We will learn about the values, attitudes and norms that historically shaped the cultures of peoples across the Atlantic. The Caribbean, Brazil and West Africa, will be our primary focuses. Specifically, you will come to understand the complexity of religious practices commonly known as Santeria, Candomble, Vodou, Palo Mayombe, Ifa, and Hoodoo, among others.

Expressions of historic memory occur in popular historical forms like community celebrations, archival collections, commemorative sites, family reunions, museum exhibits, and even video games, among many others. In this course, students learn about the ways that Public History is practiced, the rationales for undertaking this study, and the skills available to them in meeting their goals.

We will explore topics such as the origins of immigration policy in interwar Europe, anti-Semitism and the Holocaust, race and empire, post-colonial immigration from Africa and Asia, the place of Islam in European society, the emergence of anti-immigration political movements on the extreme right, and we will end the course with a discussion of the current migration crisis in Europe. This course will give students a historical as well as a contemporary perspective on questions of race and immigration in European society. In addition to our readings of leading scholars in this field, we will engage with historical documents, literature, and film, as well as with contemporary European news coverage."},{"1":"HIST 294-08","2":"Technology and the Environment in the Pre-Modern World","3":"M","4":"07:00 pm-10:00 pm","5":"MAIN 002","6":"Basit Qureshi","7":"2 / 20","8":"","9":"From volcanic activity to viral pandemics, from flooding rivers to invasive fauna, every human society has had to face material, ecological, climactic, and other such challenges particular to its environment. In this interdisciplinary course, we will investigate how human societies in the pre-modern world developed different sorts of technologies to confront and adapt to the challenges presented by their environments. Drawing upon a diverse array of sources, including glacial ice core data and saints’ lives, we will explore how human technologies changed local environments in both intended and unintended ways. Environmental consequences presented new challenges that required further technological adaptation, fundamentally shaping trajectories of societal development from classical China to medieval Europe, from ancient Oceania to the Americas. In studying the formative relationship between technology and the environment in pre-modern global contexts, we will arrive at a more informed understanding of the emergence of the modern world. For our purposes in this course, “technology” will include not only physical tools but also political-cultural ideologies, systems of government, religions, scientific theories, and techniques of domestication. “Environment” will similarly be defined broadly: climate, physical geography, biosphere, and urban settlements. This course fulfills the global and/or comparative history as well as the pre-1800 requirements for the major."},{"1":"HIST 294-10","2":"The Once and Future King: Arthur in History, Literature and Art","3":"MWF","4":"02:20 pm-03:20 pm","5":"MAIN 002","6":"Basit Qureshi","7":"2 / 20","8":"Writing WP","9":"Stories of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table have captivated audiences for over a thousand years. In this interdisciplinary course, we will examine a diversity of historical artifacts, literary texts, and artistic works that engage with Arthurian lore. We will approach each instance of such “Arthuriana” as a construct particular to its own time and place of production. Indeed, like most classics, the Arthurian legend endures not because of the allure of its original form but because of its fundamental adaptability. Camelot was, is, and will continue to be a stage on which societies play out their hopes, fears, and everything in between. Our goal, therefore, will be to illuminate and understand how contemporary social, cultural, and political agendas have shaped and, in turn, have been shaped by each compelling incarnation of Arthur’s court. Course topics will span the gamut of Arthurian tradition: from medieval Welsh folklore re-imagining the post-Roman “Dark Ages” to T.H. White’s modern saga responding to the horrors of World War II; from Sir Thomas Malory’s compendium reflecting the Wars of the Roses (the medieval inspiration for ‘A Game of Thrones’) to Monty Python’s satirical musings on a millennium of chivalry and flesh wounds."},{"1":"HIST 294-11","2":"Get in Formation: Black Protest Music","3":"MWF","4":"03:30 pm-04:30 pm","5":"MUSIC 228","6":"Crystal Moten","7":"-1 / 25","8":"U.S. Identities and Differences","9":"Throughout African American history, people of African descent in the United States have always utilized the tools at their disposal to resist oppression. This includes music. Music heals, empowers, and exposes--joy, pain, love, anger, happiness, suffering and hope. Using a black feminist, intersectional lens, this course is a topical introduction to various traditions within African American music from the enslavement period until the present. Not meant to be exhaustive, the course will examine the connections between music and major turning points in African American social, cultural, and political history. The course also pays special attention to the ways in which race, class, gender, and sexuality impact the creation, interpretation, performance, and reception of black protest music."},{"1":"HIST 378-01","2":"War Crimes and Memory in East Asia","3":"TR","4":"03:00 pm-04:30 pm","5":"MAIN 010","6":"Yue-him Tam","7":"4 / 14","8":"Internationalism","9":"This course's main goal is to introduce evidence of the major crimes and atrocities during World War II in East Asia such as the Nanjing Massacre, biochemical warfare (Unit 731), the military sexual slavery (\"comfort women\") system, the forced labor system, and inhumane treatment of POWs.

In the New World, Spaniards employed many of the same discursive and legal tactics—along with brute force—to subject Amerindian and African peoples to their will and their cultural norms. But indigenous and African populations in the Americas actively countered colonization. They rejected slavery and cultural imposition through physical rebellion, the use of strategies of cultural preservation and the appropriation of phonetic writing, which they in turn wielded against European hegemony. We will examine a fascinating corpus of indigenous pictographic codexes, architecture, myths, and histories and letters of resistance, along with a rich spectrum of texts in which peoples of African descent affirm their own subjectivity in opposition to slavery and cultural violence. What will emerge for students is a complex, heterogeneous vision of the conquest and early colonization in which non-European voices speak loudly on their own behalf.

In doing this, we trace the development of two related archetypes: the middle-class salaryman and the adolescent girl (shojo). These figures - as well as their incarnations as cyberpunks and mecha-warriors, sex workers and teen rebels - help us explore Japanese film's engagement with the strictures of middle-class society, the constrained status of women, fantasy and escapism, sexuality and desire. Weekly screenings and discussion will be supplemented by readings in film theory and cultural criticism.

The course will also outline continuing struggle for freedom, for cultural and even their physical survival, by examining specific literature and cultural production authored by 20th and 21st century indigenous and non-indigenous authors from North, Central and South America. The chosen literature and cultural texts will illustrate trans-cultural and de-colonization processes, and resistance to assimilation. The following authors and films will be the source of our readings and class discussion: Sherman Alexie (The Toughest Indian in the World, 2000), Jose Maria Arguedas (Yawar Fiesta, 1941), Victor Montejo (Testimony: Death of a Guatemalan Village, 1987; and Sculpted Stones, 1995), Rigoberta Menchú (I Rogoberta Menchú.

This variety of environments also fosters great cultural diversity: although the nations of Latin America share similar historical roots, each one has its own character and its own complex geography. This course explores the geography of Latin America through a combination of thematic and regional approaches. Major topics include physical geography and the natural environment; pre-Columbian, colonial, and modern history; race and identity; urbanism; agriculture and land use; major environmental problems; economy and development; international migration; Latino culture and identity in the U.S.; and the economic and cultural impacts of globalization. Along with such general themes, we will also examine the cultural geography of specific core regions, including The Caribbean, Mexico, Brazil, the Andean Countries, and the Argentine Pampas. Since this is a first-year course, we will also emphasize developing your skills in written and oral communication, scholarly research, and information literacy.

In the New World, Spaniards employed many of the same discursive and legal tactics—along with brute force—to subject Amerindian and African peoples to their will and their cultural norms. But indigenous and African populations in the Americas actively countered colonization. They rejected slavery and cultural imposition through physical rebellion, the use of strategies of cultural preservation and the appropriation of phonetic writing, which they in turn wielded against European hegemony. We will examine a fascinating corpus of indigenous pictographic codexes, architecture, myths, and histories and letters of resistance, along with a rich spectrum of texts in which peoples of African descent affirm their own subjectivity in opposition to slavery and cultural violence.

It was designed to re-enslave Black men who were freed from forced labor by the 13th Amendment. Chain gangs were deployed as work crews by corporations such as U.S. Steele. Chain gangs and other parts of the system of mass incarceration have been visible in Hollywood movies and in other parts of popular culture since the era of the Big Studios in the 1930s. An example is Paul Muni's 1933 film, I was a Fugitive from A Chain Gang, which is a narrative about a wrongly convicted working class White man who was swept up into prison industrial complex. But the early films represented mass incarceration as a system dominated by White inmates, whereas recent work by scholars represent the system as disproportionately African American. In this class, we will read the work of historian Michelle Alexander (The New Jim Crow), journalist Douglas Blackmon (Slavery by Another Name) and others who argue that mass incarceration has always been disproportionately Black, and we will study the ways that mass culture has begun to reflect this reality. We will begin the course by examining Paul Muni's film and then we will move on to more recent representations (COPS, Lockup, Orange is the New Black, Oz, and 13th).

The objective of the class is to familiarize students of film theory and history with the language of cinema from the standpoint of production in order to deepen your appreciation and knowledge of the technical aspects of film/video and to develop your capacity to use video as a tool for research and communication. In this way, the course will be a combination of technical instruction, critical engagement, and creative exploration. We will analyze and employ a variety of filmmaking techniques as well as constructing narrative and non-narrative strategies for doing so. The focus of the course will be to familiarize you with some basic conventions of experimental, documentary, and narrative cinema. In each assignment, you will be encouraged to think about how formal decisions enhance and further narrative or thematic elements. We will thus pay very close attention to formal aspects of cinematic production: mise-en-scene. cinematography, editing, and sound design. In addition to this attention to form, success in the class will be dependent on a commitment to working through the technical aspects of video production (camera operation, lighting, editing software) in order to create short, original video pieces.

Does music improve lives, connect individuals, foster peace and social justice? Does it divide, alienate, fuel aggression? Does music merely entertain; are its consolations false, imaginary? Are there types or modes of experience accessible only through music? How does technology factor into musically formed, human relationships? In this discussion-based course, we will examine connections between music and two powerful critical categories--empathy and alienation--whose impact spans the arts, humanities, sciences, and social sciences. Empathy, a concept that has its earliest roots in the fields of aesthetics and psychology, concerns the way we “feel into” others (and artworks, and natural forms), and thereby share our emotional lives. Alienation, also a term with wide application in the arts and social sciences, concerns the ways in which we are disconnected--from others, from our labor, from artworks. We will read historical and contemporary writings on these subjects, with critical approaches representing a range of perspectives, including aesthetics and art/music/theatre history, psychology and neuroscience, feminist and race theory, and more. We will discuss musical activity in a variety of traditions, from piano sonatas by Beethoven and symphonies by Mahler, to recordings by Radiohead and Kendrick Lamar. We will examine music as a theme in literature, and we’ll listen to some fascinating characters in opera who challenge us along empathic lines. In a semester-long independent project, students will explore a topic of their own devising; these might take the form of research papers, or creative works, or service-learning projects in the Twin Cities community.

Its central concerns are: (1) to understand the place of music in social and cultural life, (2) to gain an appreciation of the musical style and rhetoric that characterizes each of the periods we study, and (3) to develop students’ abilities in communicating, in writing and the spoken word, what they have learned about this music and the culture in which it was produced. Course activities will take several forms, including lectures, musical analyses, and performances. Lectures will introduce key terms and concepts and will address broader concerns of cultural life (including composer biographies). In-class analysis and performance will lead to a more detailed understanding of key works. Examinations will test students’ retention of course listening and lecture/discussion/reading material. Essays will give students the opportunity to delve deeper into critical and musical analysis, and to sharpen their prose, specifically with respect to writing about music. The course assumes no historical knowledge of the periods in question. However, basic skills in the analysis of music are necessary.

Light switches don’t work in dreams, so if you flip a light switch and it works, you know you’re awake. But Waking Life is fiction, and this test doesn’t really work. Is there any test that always distinguishes dreams from reality? If not, can we ever know for sure that we’re not dreaming? For that matter, can we know that we’re not brains in vats, hooked up to sophisticated computers in some kind of awful post-apocalyptic future, a la The Matrix? And if it turns out that we can’t know about anything outside our own minds, what follows? Would it even matter? In Introduction to Philosophy, we will consider those questions, and others. Topics of discussion will include the nature of the human mind, the foundations of ethics, the existence of God, and the possibility of free will. Our readings will include a range of historical and contemporary works of philosophy, science, and literature.

These occur in political rhetoric, advertising campaigns, and among friends and family. Many arguments are persuasive. But some persuasive arguments are incorrect (some of these abuse statistics, some are actually fallacies); and some correct arguments are not very persuasive (at least not immediately). Logic is the science of correct reasoning and argumentation, and symbolic logic is the use of symbols and formal rules to codify this correctness. Our approach is formal – symbolic logic depends only on the form of arguments rather than their content. (This course is thus somewhat abstract and theoretical; it is not a course on applied critical thinking.) We will focus on formal properties of deductive arguments; our tools and methods constitute the fundamental methods of contemporary symbolic logic. In symbolic logic symbols represent types of sentences, and rules are cited for each inference. Thus, proofs in this course are somewhat like proofs in geometry: they both depend on clear criteria for correctness and incorrectness. The course divides into the following standard topics: 1. Formalization of arguments in propositional logic. 2. Natural Deduction: learning and applying formal rules of proof. 3. Truth tables and semantic trees. 4. Formalization of arguments in predicate logic. 5. Natural Deduction: proofs in Predicate Logic. The immediate aim of this course is to provide you with some formal methods for (i) determining whether or not an argument has a correct form, and (ii) proving a conclusion from a given set of premises. In addition to learning a formal system, the tools acquired in this course can be applied to real arguments, and logic helps students distinguish good arguments from bad ones, and to justify such distinctions. Logic also helps students improve their writing, as it assists in articulating the logical structure of an argument. Finally, logic is central to mathematics as well as philosophy. This course provides a good foundation for both majors, and indeed any discipline that emphasizes correct, clear thinking, reading and writing.

Perhaps no two thinkers have asked this question as persistently and approached it with such intrepid originality as Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud.

Both were reacting to Darwin’s discovery of natural selection, which dispelled nature’s divine aura and inaugurated what Nietzsche would call the “death of God.” The course explores the challenges to value judgments in the wake of Darwin and attempted solutions to them, centering on the four domains of ethics, subjectivity, aesthetics, and cultural value. Readings will include excerpts from Darwin’s The Origin of Species; Nietzsche’s The Genealogy of Morals, The Gay Science, and the texts posthumously published as The Will to Power; Freud’s Totem and Taboo, Civilization and Its Discontents, and Beyond the Pleasure Principle; as well as other works.

This question is a key one for the philosophy of technology, a field of critical inquiry aimed giving the material environment of our lives its philosophical due.  In this course, which also counts as an elective in the critical theory concentration, we will draw upon a variety of approaches associated with the philosophy of technology, including phenomenology, pragmatism, actor-network theory, critical theory of technology, and feminist technoscience. We will look at long-standing debates over how to define technology and over what drives technological change. We will ask: What is the relationship between science and technology? Does it make sense to speak of technology, or only about technologies? We will also be asking questions about ethics. What does it mean to be a moral and political agent in a world increasingly populated by robots, drones, tabletop assistants, and self-driving vehicles? Do robots have what it takes to be moral agents? What ethical risks are posed by technologies that track and persuade us? How much of my freedom and decision-making should I “outsource” to artificially-intelligent, interactive things?

Unlike European nations, the United States did not inherit economic class distinctions from a feudal past. But time and again, American social reformers and mass movements have highlighted inconsistencies between the value of equality and the actual practice of democracy. Through the extension of rights to citizens who were previously excluded or treated as second-class citizens, such as women and African Americans, the polity has become more inclusive. But over the last three decades American citizens have grown increasingly unequal in terms of income and wealth. The central question posed by this course is the implications of such vast economic inequality for American democracy. Do these disparities between citizens curtail, limit, and perhaps threaten the functioning of genuinely representative governance? In this course will 1) Explore what other social scientists, mostly economists and sociologists, know about contemporary inequality, particularly in terms of its causes, manifestation, and socio-economic effects; 2) Consider the concept of inequality in political theory and in American political thought, and; 3) Examine the current relationship between economic inequality and each of three major aspects of the American political system: political voice, representation, and public policy.

This body of thought is worthy of sustained study for two reasons. First, it is one of the glories of human civilization. In seeking to answer the timeless question \"how we should live our lives as individuals\" and \"how we should live together in peace and justice\" late medieval political thinkers produced a body of political thought second to none in the history of human philosophical speculation. Second, late medieval political thought is worthy of study because it gave rise to many of the concepts that continue to shape our collective lives today (including state sovereignty, separation of church and state, constitutionalism, just war, property rights, \"the people,\" nationalism, democracy, rule-of-law, and human rights). Indeed, it is impossible to really understand contemporary political life without delving deeply into the way in which late medieval thinkers engaged with the big political issues of their day.  The main goal of this course is to provide a solid introduction to the political thought of this crucially important era in human history. In it, we will critically examine the relevant works of thinkers such as St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, John of Paris, Marsilius of Padua, Bartolus of Sasseferato, and Baldus de Ubaldi.

We will then turn to cognitive psychology to describe the mental and emotional processes that underlie the judgments and decisions we make when faced with data vs. personal experience. We will also explore social psychological theories and studies that help explain why people deny climate change even in places where its impacts are likely to be severe.

Scholars studying non-Western religious traditions, however, have in recent decades given close attention to the culture of which any given religious tradition is a part, studying as much the popular culture as elite and institutional expressions. This course is an attempt, in part, to apply the approaches developed by comparative historians of religion and anthropologists to the study of some of the cultures influenced by Catholicism, and to understand current issues and debates on, for example, sexual politics, liturgy, or theology and Church authority, in that context. We will begin with a consideration of the place of Catholicism within American culture, some of the conflicts between American and Catholic values, in light of the long history of the Catholic Church in the West. We will then turn to particular cultural and ritual expressions of Catholic faith.

In this course, we will find out by investigating the history of complex religious practices such as Haitian Voudou, which originated with West African Vodou and Kongolese religious practices as the slaves from these regions were brought to the island of Hispaniola during the trans-Atlantic slave system and changed over time as people continuously interacted across the Atlantic world. We will also explore other African-based religions. For example, the orisha religions of Yoruba peoples in West Africa came to places such as Brazil and Cuba at various points in both the legal and illicit slave trading periods. Peoples of African descent experienced a bricolage of cultural impacts and remade themselves in the Americas but did not forget ties to the homeland. Religions such as Christianity and Islam also inserted themselves into these communities and emerged intertwined. The movements of Africans and their descendants came to North America adapting and adopting even more of their practices to meet specific needs. We will learn about the values, attitudes and norms that historically shaped the cultures of peoples across the Atlantic. The Caribbean, Brazil and West Africa, will be our primary focuses. Specifically, you will come to understand the complexity of religious practices commonly known as Santeria, Candomble, Vodou, Palo Mayombe, Ifa, and Hoodoo, among others. By placing these systems in an appropriate historical context, we will identify and analyze key elements, biases and influences that shape the disciplines of History and World Religions."},{"1":"RELI 294-02","2":"Comparative Muslim Cultures","3":"MWF","4":"03:30 pm-04:30 pm","5":"CARN 404","6":"Jenna Rice Rahaim","7":"0 / 20","8":"U.S. Identities and Differences","9":""},{"1":"RELI 359-01","2":"Religion and Revolution: Case Studies","3":"W","4":"07:00 pm-10:00 pm","5":"MAIN 111","6":"Erik Davis","7":"15 / 20","8":"","9":"An examination of five revolutions and their religious engagements: The Diggers and the English Civil War, The Taiping Rebellion in China, Buddhism and the Cambodian Revolution, Cultural Rebirth and Resistance in Native America, and the Algerian Islamist Revolution.

As with much else in a democracy, deciding whom to teach, what to teach, and how to teach have been subjects of lively debate in the US from the early nineteenth century to the dawning of the twenty-first. This course offers a broad overview of the overarching political controversies surrounding the historical development of public schooling in America. We begin with a survey of 19th-century movements to define elementary schooling as the chosen instrument for nation-building, for safeguarding democratic self-governance, and for resolving with the cascading social disorders implicated in the rise of urbanization, mass immigration, and industrial capitalism. The rise of high schools in the early twentieth century is the second major topic of interest, and more specifically, progressive-era debates about the relationship between public schools and colleges and universities. This era begets the great ideological fault-lines underlying educational theory and practice in the US that lasted through the 20th century into the 21st. The dramatic post-war reconstruction of public schooling is the third major focus of the course. We explore the proliferation of federal government mandates to secularize, integrate, assimilate, equalize, multiculturalize, and expunge racism and sexism from the curriculum, all the while raising academic standards for all. With these directives came vastly expanded government funding for social science research trained on evaluating public schools' efforts to realize these new benchmarks of educational progress. We observe this rebirth of the social sciences as arbiters of educational policy debates. The final section of the course revolves around contemporary disputes over school choice policies and the federal No-Child-Left-Behind initiatives. These latest campaigns to democratize academic excellence have followed a familiar, recurring script of US policy making since the 1980s: deregulation, de-centralization, consumer choice, managerial and administrative prerogatives in public agencies re-invented in the image of governance in the corporate sector, and the elaboration of benchmarks to measure the effectiveness and efficiency of educational practices. We consider how recent experience indicate limitations to privatization, corporatization, and marketization as solutions to the educational crisis, and perhaps, suggest the beginnings of a renewed search for answers to the riddle of public education.

How does migration reconfigure social relationships, such as parental and community relations?

How to aesthetic and social projects, including visual art, theatre, performance events, and dance, engage with the many registers of thinking, what Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak calls 'a planetary' arts and criticism? In this class we assess some of the ways that performance artists and theorists conceptualize and address formal artistic methodologies, culture, and the politics of performance in an era of globalization. Our premise is that all researchers are cultural producers, at once located within processes of globalization and mapping their terrains. Understanding theory as the attempt to practice and articulate methods of action (nothing more, nothing less) we examine some of the essential critical vocabularies for thinking performance and the social together. Readings in Performance research, in addition to Critical Theory, Feminist/Queer Theory, and critical race theory contribute to our study of contemporary Performance Theory. Specific theme may vary by semester, depending on instructor.

It will analyze feminist and queer histories of resistance and alternatives to economic and political control, in the U.S. and elsewhere. The framework for the course is the intersection of gender and sexuality with race, class, nationality, and dis/ability; it will address such issues as economic marginalization, social movements, the institutions of family and marriage, migration and the role of the state/nation among others.

The course centrally examines how feminist and queer studies transform societies and are transformed through struggle over their gender/sexual identities, racial formations, and global/transnational locations. The course considers how feminist and queer studies have arisen in close relationships¿of union, tension, and antagonism¿and how feminist and queer work today may link.

Too often, the narrative of the “strong black woman” infuses stories of African American women’s resistance which, coupled with a culture of dissemblance, makes the inner workings of their lives difficult to imagine. This course, at its heart, seeks to uncover the motivations, both personal and political, behind African American women’s activism. It also aims to address the ways in which African American women have responded to the pressing social, economic, and political needs of their diverse communities. The course also asks students to consider narrative, voice and audience in historical writing, paying particular attention to the ways in which black women’s history has been written over the course of the twentieth century.

It is based on the premise that 'whiteness' as an academic/social framework stems from and is intertwined with social and political identity-based movements (feminist, critical race, etc.). In other words, studies of the intersection of gender, race, class, and nation initiated in the post-colonizing imagination seeks to shake up paradigms of power, and whiteness studies shares in this effort. This course explores where and how the notion of 'whiteness' converges and diverges from post-colonialism."},{"1":"WGSS 252-01","2":"Gender, Sexualities and Feminist Visual Culture","3":"TR","4":"09:40 am-11:10 am","5":"ARTCOM 102","6":"Joanna Inglot","7":"0 / 16","8":"Writing WA","9":"This course will examine the issues of gender, sexuality and feminist visual culture in the 20th century and contemporary art.

This includes music. Music heals, empowers, and exposes--joy, pain, love, anger, happiness, suffering and hope. Using a black feminist, intersectional lens, this course is a topical introduction to various traditions within African American music from the enslavement period until the present. Not meant to be exhaustive, the course will examine the connections between music and major turning points in African American social, cultural, and political history.

In this transnational comparative context, we will focus on how various feminisms have negotiated these intertwined political/economic theories, at once emerging from them, claiming a place in them, as well as self-defining against their different formations. We will explore how liberal, second- and third- wave, socialist, women of color, radical transnational, and indigenous feminisms deploy the notion of Object in addressing issues of citizenship, violence, labor, the environment, cultural representation, etc., as ways of tackling this complicated relationship with diverse forms of capitalism and democracy.

7. Create a graph that shows the number of sections offered per department. Hint: The department is a substring of the course number - there are `str_XXX()` functions that can help. Yes, COMP and MATH are the same department, but for this exercise you can just show the results by four letter department code, e.g., with COMP and MATH separate.


```r
mac_courses %>%
  mutate(dep = substr(course_nums, 0, 4)) %>%
  group_by(dep) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = dep)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Number of Sections", 
       y = "Department", 
       title = "Number of Sections offered per Department")
```

8. Analyze the typical length of course names by department. To do so, create a new data table based on your courses data table, with the following changes:
  
  * New columns for the length of the title of a course and the length of the description of the course. Hint: `str_length`.  
  * Remove departments that have fewer than 10 sections of courses. To do so, group by department, then remove observations in groups with fewer than 10 sections (Hint: use filter with n()). Then `ungroup()` the data.  
  * Create a visualization of the differences across groups in lengths of course names or course descriptions. Think carefully about the visualization you should be using!



```r
mac_courses %>%
  mutate(title_l = str_length(course_names)) %>%
  mutate(desc_l = str_length(course_desc)) %>%
  mutate(dep = substr(course_nums, 0, 4)) %>%
  group_by(dep) %>%
  mutate(num = n()) %>%
  filter(num > 10) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = dep, x = title_l)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun.x = mean, geom ="point", shape = "circle", size = 1, color="red", fill = "red") +
  labs(title = "Course Title Length by Department",
